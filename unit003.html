<h2>
3.1. AutoCAD and BIM (building information modeling) 
</h2>

<p>
As coined by Autodesk the acronym BIM (Building Information Modeling) represents the way Revit enables 
architects, designers, and engineers to capture decisions during the design process and incorporate them 
into the overall database that represents the 3D virtual prototype of the building. This concept perhaps 
not practiced effectively and entirely not in digital format has always been the intention and attempt of 
the built environment professional.  In such regard to attain the intended qualities of BIM , the professional 
(planner, designer and engineer) needs to incorporate a very careful preparation phase before using AutoCAD software 
towards preparing documents and sharing them. AutoCAD architecture and other specialized products of Autodesk are more 
related to BIM than the standard AutoCAD software.

<h2>
3.2. Brief recap on AutoCAD interface 
</h2>
<p>Concerning interfaces it helps if you start by thinking that most software are now generally similar in their layout. 
If you use other software such as Microsoft Word, you will be familiar with many of the interface layout of 
AutoCAD as there are many similarities. Therefore mind how much of your interface/user experience from those 
software are transferable here and avoid feeling stranger to the interface.  
In AutoCAD, you will create  and edit drawings in the model space, layout space and block editor interface. 
You will make other editing by filling out prompts in windows such as options (where you will fill your 
preferences, etc.),  text and other styles in a similar fashion.  You can also use script files by creating 
them with in AutoCAD in the visual lisp window. You can also create script files such lisp files (.lsp), 
line files (.lin) and pattern files (.pat) externally in notepad or other editors and integrate them back 
to AutoCAD. Such script files can also be found online and users can download them according to their needs 
(short link). The latter ones will be covered in the latter subchapters of this self study AutoCAD package, 
professional application of AutoCAD and pedagogy of computer aided design.  
However, the general understanding of the interface are coved in the following pages of this document as 
follows:

<h3>Study about the 12 indicated interface components of AutoCAD on the following image and related link. </h3>

               </div>

<!-- <a href="interface01.html" target="_blank" > Please visit this page for further study on the first part of your basic interface AutoCAD  </a> -->
<h3>Study about the 18 indicated interface components of AutoCAD on the following image and related link. </h3>

You will find this interface once you opened a new project or an exiting project in AutoCAD.  There are generally 18 
important components of the interface you want to study. They are described in the next slides. 
You can also find these decryptions on the provided power point presentation (short link: ) <br><br>
<div class="containerHover" style="background-color:white">
<a href="interface01.html" target="_blank" ><img src="flexbox/back.png" alt="AutoCAD Interface basic" class="pics" width="100%"></a>
<div class="middle">
               <div class="text01">click on this image to further take a look at the interface information</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>At this point it is important to note the fact that in AutoCAD software there are also interface components that are  
               by default floating and  docked panels or can be made floating and docked according to the userâ€™s preference. 
               These components include Properties panel, layer properties manager, etc. You can right click on any object
                you are drawing (creating) or editing and open the properties panel which you can implement as floating 
                (not attached to fixed components of the interface) or docked (attached to fixed interface components) 
                interface component.  This topic will be continue sly mentioned during your exercise activities.
