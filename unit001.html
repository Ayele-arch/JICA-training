<h2> 1.1.  Objective of the training 
</h2><undefined>To render the Youth Employment Project for Somalia (YEPS) project with introductory self-preparation
               instruction materials and personal hands on trainings on Computer aided design through the software
               AutoCAD. The training addresses mid-level career engineers such as ( 1) Engineers working at the ministry
               in charge of the public works and construction, (2) Engineers from private construction companies, and
               (3) Professors of University professors. It encompasses the application of the software in various
               professionals of the built environment, such us planning (Urban), construction and design (Architectural,
               interior, sanitary and electrical and landscape). The training incorporates the application and pedagogy
               of CAD specifically AutoCAD. </undefined>

<h2> 1.2.  Plan and strategy of the Introductory AutoCAD self-study and in person training  
</h2>
<p>
Both the introductory self-study and in person training of AutoCAD will consider the usage of interactive tools or methods such as usage of website and google drive eservices for exchange of learning and teaching activities. 
As the concept of ‘introductory self-study’ suggests a remote teaching and learning approach, the trainees will follow through the introductory self-study materials and forward feedbacks and questions at every stage of their training through the above mentioned means. And they will promptly get feedback from their trainer accordingly.  
During the in person training that comes after the remote training, while still makes use of the above methods, will intensively address the trainees with hands on laboratory demonstrations and  practices. 

Autodesk recognizes the advantages of third party developers and other contributes in such as researchers and students of the built environment. Such cases can be seen in the EiABC’s research named Ethioplugin (EP) (http://eiabc.edu.et/index.php/research/ethioplug-in-add-on-library) (https://drive.google.com/file/d/0Bz-tUmMcmpNeUTBVbXhVYnpBOEE/view?usp=sharing) where Autodesk (Revit architecture, AutoCAD, etc.) and other software are used to document and transform Ethiopian local attributes. As such users of Community and Commercial CAD software should look in to the opportunity. Similarly this training shall constitute the active consideration of contribution in such regard through the process of teaching and learning.
