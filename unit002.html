<p>
Before Autodesk was one of the most prestigious companies for a day job seekers today, 
it started as an extracurricular activity by visionary programmers such as Mike Riddle during 
the early 1980s. The significance of this discussion in addition to the interest to learn about the 
emergence of AutoCAD lays in knowing the fact that Mike Riddle while developing his graphic software 
Interact worked at Frank Lloyd's Foundation and had observed the designers and planners working in the 
foundation where he had found an opportunity to test and develop his software among architects and designers 
of the foundation. This latter led to his collaboration with his fellow programmer John Walker to conceive 
AutoCAD as a CAD software. In latter developments of the company ,Autodesk, John Walker was observed 
passing remarks at new officials of the company as managers that do not have understanding of the 
CAD industry during the phases of the company were regressions are noted. 
</p>
<p>
Malcolm McCullough the current professor of architecture, as a student of architecture in 1983 made a 
drawing of the Golden Gate Bridge that got international attention at the time adding to the positive 
impression of Autodesk in the CAD industry.   <br>            
The above points are relevant to our discussion because the importance of the built environment professionals, 
researchers and students is unequivocal. Such is still the case in the current period of the CAD industry 
professionals, researchers and students contributing, criticizing and using the CAD software. In the latter 
developments of its growth, Autodesk has also contributed to industries other than the built environment such 
as entertainment, scientific simulations and molecular studies.

<p>
Autodesk through its visionary founding member John Walker’s early exceptional understanding of the importance 
and potential of personal computers in the CAD industry came to be a leading CAD software provider. Furthermore 
the company entertained the contributions of third party developers through functionalities of the AutoCAD 
software such as Auto lisp. 

</p>
<p>
The company reached out to global users through international venders and  has customized its products to different languages of different courtiers around the world. <br>
New developments of the company marked by  recent CEO of the company Carol Bartz has made Autodesk to be one of the leading CAD software providers in community and commercial packages today. 
Based on the above understanding of the CAD industry if there is a nonsatisfaction of users (professionals of the built environment) while using the CAD software, it can partly be seen as the fact that leaders of the CAD industry are in short of understanding of the CAD industry from time to time which can be corrected through their close attention to the planners, designers and engineers of the built environment just like Mike Riddle did at the Frank Lloyd Write’s foundation that helped start the industry in the first place as far as Autodesk is concerned.

               2.2. Brief Insight on Application of Different Scale Projects in AutoCAD 
</h2>
<p>
As opposed to the current trends of software specialization that is seen through the emergence of 
software that encamps only an integrated work process for specific scale of projects in the built industry, 
AutoCAD remains being on of the CAD software that can support any scale of projects: connection detail to urban 
planning level, while other software such as Revit at building level, GIS at large scale spatial study, etc. 
As professionals of the built environment research across these boundaries, the fact that AutoCAD with the 
extra required preparation and careful need for documentation and management can allow them think through 
this boundaries during their project implementations and its management.
