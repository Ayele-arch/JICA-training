<p>
As coined by Autodesk the acronym BIM (Building Information Modeling) represents the way Revit enables 
architects, designers, and engineers to capture decisions during the design process and incorporate them 
into the overall database that represents the 3D virtual prototype of the building. This concept perhaps 
not practiced effectively and entirely not in digital format has always been the intention and attempt of 
the built environment professional.  In such regard to attain the intended qualities of BIM , the professional 
(planner, designer and engineer) needs to incorporate a very careful preparation phase before using AutoCAD software 
towards preparing documents and sharing them. AutoCAD architecture and other specialized products of Autodesk are more 
related to BIM than the standard AutoCAD software.    
</p>
<p>

Common work processes ( in CAD): 
If we take a look at the common trends projects may start with a client that already acquired a land (through lease) 
or planning to acquire one. In large scale development, it is common get public invitation bid announcements through public 
Medias, newspapers for qualified consultants to participate in the design work needed the development. This scenario may 
differ for small projects such as a single family’s residential project, etc. Once the consultant buys the bid for large 
projects or gets approached by a small scale developer, client, he or she will acquire a terms of reference with a Procurement 
Reference Number. This provides the consultant with legal right to visit the indicated project site in the terms of reference 
for the intended task.  He or she will visit the site and confirms the conditions described in the bid’s title deed map 
(site plan: boundaries, etc.) are correct. And furthermore the consultant collects further data he or she may need to
prepare the design documents needed as per the bid, for the task the consultant uses surveyors and other related 
professionals for getting geo-information’s of the location.  The terms of reference in addition to providing information 
about the project site it also passes regulations, design tasks, interest of the client, the format and type of 
digital information the client suggest for the submittals (for example architectural design drawings in .dwg format, 
report in .dox or .pdf format and presentations in panels, models and video animations). 
Below is an image of a typical title deed map consultants are presented by clients before starting to work on a project.
Mind the indication of the visual and coordinate description of the site.

</p>

<p>

Therefore it is important to identify at what point the consultant needs to start digitizing exiting information 
and new once for the project at hand. Based on site information gained from the terms of reference and from the 
site visit or reconnaissance, the consultant begins to organize digital documents that will latter transform towards 
the preparation and compilation of the required documents to be submitted for the client for evaluation and further 
plans. 
The above discussion is mostly important to note that digital documentation and design process within construction 
developments has 
been made mandatory for many years, in Ethiopia for almost two decades. 
The new work processes intended (in CAD ): 
Currently there are indications that digital documentation in itself is not sufficient rather the standard (or quality) 
at which these 
documentations allow efficient work process throughout a development, hence the interest for implementation of BIM, which 
requires a central integrated three dimensional model meant to allow most if not all stakeholders involved in a development 
to collaborate, exchange interoperable data. 

This demand will have its challenges and success for various reasons. That can include: the provision of CAD and related 
software that can facilitate such work flow, the capacity of such design tools to incorporate various local work methods 
and cultures, impact on local economies and last but not least design and other professionals that might find the system 
difficult for them to shape development through their creative processes and outputs.  
However, the usual observation is that designers and other professionals long before the digital revolution have been working 
towards what these new developments are suggesting. Collaboration among different professionals was an interest of the ancient 
mater builder as the master builder coordinates different professionals towards an intended output.
In this tutorial we will see how we can use AutoCAD effectively and conduct possible work processes and documentations.  
The general summary descriptions of BIM is indicated in the figure below. Trainees should use the abbreviations provided under the content table of this document to understand the acronyms used in the figure and follow the discussion in the tutorial video that will be provided.

<p>Concerning interfaces it helps if you start by thinking that most software are now generally similar in their layout. 
If you use other software such as Microsoft Word, you will be familiar with many of the interface layout of 
AutoCAD as there are many similarities. Therefore mind how much of your interface/user experience from those 
software are transferable here and avoid feeling stranger to the interface.  
In AutoCAD, you will create  and edit drawings in the model space, layout space and block editor interface. 
You will make other editing by filling out prompts in windows such as options (where you will fill your 
preferences, etc.),  text and other styles in a similar fashion.  You can also use script files by creating 
them with in AutoCAD in the visual lisp window. You can also create script files such lisp files (.lsp), 
line files (.lin) and pattern files (.pat) externally in notepad or other editors and integrate them back 
to AutoCAD. Such script files can also be found online and users can download them according to their needs 
(short link). The latter ones will be covered in the latter subchapters of this self study AutoCAD package, 
professional application of AutoCAD and pedagogy of computer aided design.  
However, the general understanding of the interface are covered in the following pages of this document as 
follows:

<h3>Study about the 18 indicated interface components of AutoCAD on the following image and related link. </h3>

You will find this interface once you opened a new project or an exiting project in AutoCAD.  There are generally 18 
important components of the interface you want to study. They are described in the next slides. 
You can also find these descriptions on the provided power point presentation (short link: ) <br><br>

<p>At this point it is important to note the fact that in AutoCAD software there are also interface components that are  
               by default floating and  docked panels or can be made floating and docked according to the user’s preference. 
               These components include Properties panel, layer properties manager, etc. You can right click on any object
                you are drawing (creating) or editing and open the properties panel which you can implement as floating 
                (not attached to fixed components of the interface) or docked (attached to fixed interface components) 
                interface component.  This topic will be continue sly mentioned during your exercise activities.
