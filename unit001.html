<h2> 1.1.  Objective of the training 
</h2><undefined>To render the Youth Employment Project for Somalia (YEPS) project with introductory self-preparation
               instruction materials and personal hands on trainings on Computer aided design through the software
               AutoCAD. The training addresses mid-level career engineers such as ( 1) Engineers working at the ministry
               in charge of the public works and construction, (2) Engineers from private construction companies, and
               (3) Professors of University professors. It encompasses the application of the software in various
               professionals of the built environment, such us planning (Urban), construction and design (Architectural,
               interior, sanitary and electrical and landscape). The training incorporates the application and pedagogy
               of CAD specifically AutoCAD. </undefined>

<h2> 1.2.  Plan and strategy of the Introductory AutoCAD self-study and in person training  
</h2>
<p>
Both the introductory self-study and in person training of AutoCAD will consider the usage of interactive tools or methods 
such as usage of website and google drive services for exchange of learning and teaching activities. 
As the concept of ‘introductory self-study’ suggests a remote teaching and learning approach, the trainees will follow through
 the introductory self-study materials and forward feedbacks and questions at every stage of their training through the above 
 mentioned means. And they will promptly get feedback from their trainer accordingly.  
During the in person training that comes after the remote training, while still makes use of the above methods, will 
address the trainees with hands on laboratory demonstrations , practices and assignments. Their final project with regards to 
preparation of documents should include the step by step creation of the building indicated schematically in 3D as shown below:

</p>
<p>
Further more in addition to early demonstrations and exercises, trainees shall engage in the spirit of the fact that they will be 
passing over their experience while participating on this course in reflect on their experience while working on the chapter that 
deals with pedagogy of CAD. 
</p>

<p>
Autodesk recognizes the advantages of third party developers and other contributes in such as researchers and students of the 
built environment. Such cases can be seen in the EiABC’s research named 
<a href="http://eiabc.edu.et/index.php/research/ethioplug-in-add-on-library">Ethioplugin (EP), </a> &nbsp 
<a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0Bz-tUmMcmpNeUTBVbXhVYnpBOEE/view?usp=sharing"> Lecture</a> where Autodesk 
Revit architecture, AutoCAD and other software are used to document and transform Ethiopian local attributes. 
As such users of Community and Commercial CAD software should look in to the opportunity. Similarly this training 
shall constitute the active consideration of contribution in such regard through the process of teaching and learning.   
</p>

<p>In the notion that it is important to interpret and integrate the usage and implementation of the CAD industry products 
for education, design , planing and in general the development of the built environment to local cultures, skill and environments. 
</p>

<p>           
The training, covers topics such as: AutoCAD, Autodesk and the computer Aided Design industry , Introductory Discussion on 
AutoCAD and Preparation for Projects , Professional Application of AutoCAD  and Pedagogy of CAD. The strategy of the training and the topics 
mentioned and how they are dealt with should be an indication for the trainees to consider it foe their understanding while working on the 
demonstrations,exercises and assignments of this curse. This is to mean that the compilation, details and general topics covered and delivery 
of the training shall lend it self to the objective of the trining partially.    </p>
